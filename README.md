## Features

- **User Registration & Login:** Secure authentication for a personalized experience.

- **Video Library:** Record, save, and revisit past conversations for introspection.
- **Post-Conversation Summary:** AI-powered insights into each conversation, turned into a spoken video via the Synthesia API.

## Technology Stack

The current stack that supports the LIVE demo is different from this codebase. After seeing the long render time for AI videos that's needed for real-time communication, we adjusted the product. Here's the stack for the demo:

- **Backend:** Python & Django for robust application logic and server-side rendering.
- **Frontend:** Bootstrap & Vue.js, delivered via CDNs, for an interactive UI.
- **Server & WSGI:** WSGI server with synchronous communication.
- **Environment Isolation:** Pyenv for isolated Python environments.
- **Containerization:** Docker & docker-compose for reproducible deployments.
- **Cloud Servers:** Hosted on Google Cloud's "serverless" App Engine (GAE).
- **Database:** Transitioned from Google Cloud's Datastore to PostgreSQL.

## Installation

Detailed installation instructions will be provided soon.
